本人最近把墨水的《执魔》又从头到尾看了一遍，更加觉得这是一部不可多得的优秀的网络作品。
我非常能够理解当时墨水为什么需要在这个作品中加入h，当然，这部作品这正吸引我的原因也正是因为把h的元素从中剥离后，本作仍然能够结构完整而丰满。
当然，现在墨水数月一更的进度实在尴尬，故老夫决定通过制作wiki的方式，变相为《执魔》一作增加人气，以保证本作品能够继续。
完善wiki需要各位朋友的帮助，所以我打算在本贴中加以介绍。
我已经创建了wiki的initial project：https://zhimo-wiki.herokuapp.com/
由于我所用的server：heroku的服务在北美地区，故下文中关于administration/authentication/deployment的内容我会用英文书写，诸道友权当学习一下即可。

Current website: https://zhimo-wiki.herokuapp.com/
Heroku is a platform for users to easily deploy web services,
The service of heroku is blocked by the GFS, you cannot access this site unless you have some tools like a virtual private network. The solution for this is that I will “transfer” temporarily to my own vocate domain: qiushanbk.com. Everyone in mainland chian have access to this site. But as I just started this project, it might take a few days for this integration to finish. So far, if you can already access the heroku site, you can just start editing by signing up accounts and login.

Some basic rules:
I use wiki.js as the main library for this project https://github.com/Requarks/wiki. Wiki.js is a mature library for wiki pages, but there still might be hazards on the network security (im not network security major). So in order to make the service stable, please do not write any scripts for attacks, or do other irrelevant stuff on the site/domain.
No inappropriate stuff: pornographic, violence, political etc.禁止h，暴力，政治等等。

Collaboration request:
Everyone, despite whether or not you have programming skills, is welcome to join the developer group, as long as you are open to learn new stuff. But before you get started on coding, make sure you get familiar with following terms:
Git, node.js, javascript, html, CSS, SQL postgres
Github link: TBD
QQ群： TBD
You need at least a github account and heroku account.
